Interaction of Cellular and Network Mechanisms in Spatiotemporal
Pattern Formation in Neuronal Networks J. Neurosci. 29: 1677-1687;

Implemented with NEURON 5.9, four model neurons with varying
excitability properties affect the spatiotemporal patterning of small
world networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell population.

Usage:

Either autolaunch from ModelDB after NEURON is installed or

1. Unzip bogaard2009.zip into an empty directory
2. Compile mod files
3. Double click on either homrun.hoc or hetrun.hoc to run homogeneous
or heterogeneous networks, respectively. Each should finish in a
matter of minutes (25 secs on a 2.4 MHz dual intel P8600), depending
on computer speed.

homrun.hoc will generate

and hetrun.hoc will generate

<img src="./screenshothet.jpg" alt="screenshot of heter. run">


How to Compile Mod Files
unix: use command nrnivmodl
windows: run mknrndll.hoc and follow instructions

homrun.hoc              Print to screen raster plots depicting
differing activity of four homogeneous networks with different cell
composition for same network parameters.
hetrun.hoc              Print to screen raster plot of switching
activity similar to that in Fig 8.E
modelspecs.hoc  	Model neuron templates
homrig.hoc		Homogeneous network source code
hetrig.hoc		Heterogeneous network source code

Discrepancies in publication/supplemental material:

I_Kdr gating variable is described as n^4, but is n (to the first
power) in the model.

Dendrite radius is given as 12um, but the diameter is 12um in the
model.

I_Na gating variable m time constant is given as .2ms, but is .02 in
the model.

The K_A equation which reads (1 + exp(V + 40)/5))^-1 is missing a
parenthesis and should read (1 + exp((V + 40)/5))^-1.

g_Ih for cells A and B are switched in Table 1.

g_IKdr for cell A is given as .2S/cm^2 but is .1 in the model.

Figure 1 indicates indicates unit mA, which should be nA.
